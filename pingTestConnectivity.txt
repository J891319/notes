Ping is a tool used to test connections between a server and your 
computer.
Ping will test connectivity by sending packets of data to a server and 
recording the response time, the packet loss, the packets received, and 
the server of the site.

The way you use ping is by opening a terminal and typing:
ping www.website.com
There are also some arguments that you can add to the command to change 
the way it sends the packets.
-t numberOfHops - allows you to set how many hops until the packet 
expires.
-s NUMBER - will set the size of the packets sent to the server.
-M do - will set a flag saying NOT to fragment the packets.

We can set a do not fragment flag and use the load size of the packets 
we are sending to find out the maximum packet size that can be sent to 
the server without being fragmented, using trial and error.

We can also use -t to find out how many hops away the server is using 
trial and error.
