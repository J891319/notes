nslookup is a tool used to find information about a server, including:

    aliases
    servers
    IP addresses
    Server Addresses

To use nslookup, open a terminal and type:
     nslookup www.website.com
When this command is done it will give you some basic info on the site. 
E.G: sever address and aliases.

There is also an interactive mode on nslookup, which means that you can 
just type a name of a site and it will give you info.
To use this mode, just type:
nslookup
Then interactive mode is on and you can run tests without having to type 
'nslookup' everytime.

If you want to search for data on a specific server, you can do that 
like so:
server 1.1.1.1

If you want to customize your query type you can do that by typing this 
while in interactive mode:
set type=X
there are many different types of query, the default is 'A'.
MX - would search for the preferred mail exchanger for the website or 
server.
SOA - would search for the primary domain name, mail domain, the serial 
number, how often the zone is refreshed, it will also tell you how often 
it will retry to refresh if it doesn't get a response back, and when it 
will stop trying to refresh the zone if it fails, and finally,  the 
servers default time delay.
Knowing the serial can be useful as sometimes the serial is a date, so 
we can tell if the server is outdated.

if you want to save the output to a file, you can do that with this on 
the end of the command:
>> fileName.txt
E.G:
nslookup google.com >> nslookup.txt
The file will be saved to your current working directory.
This DOES NOT work in interactive mode.
>> - appends to the file
> - replaces
So if you want to keep adding data to the file just keep using the '>>'. 
If not, use '>'.

If you want to change the query type for a non-interactive scan, you 
have to go into interactive mode, set the query type, then exit 
interactive mode, and run your scan.
