The five stages of a hack are normally:

    reconnaissance
    scanning
    gaining access
    maintaining access
    covering our tracks

Before you begin your attack, you must gather information about the 
target.
All the information found out should be documented. This process is 
called Footprinting.

The two types of reconnaissance are active or passive.
passive reconnaissance is when you go through an secondary source.
Active reconnaissance is when you directly reach out to the target.

Things you should do to get information internally (with physical 
access) :

    DNS servers
    Private websites
    Dumpster Diving - what can you learn from the trash?
    Shoulder Surfing - what do you see?
    Eavesdropping - over hear conversations.

Things you should do to get information externally (across the Internet) 
:

    Phone (SE)
    Network - What are they using?: WiFi, Modems, Satellite, ETC
    Public website
    Email (SE)
    The Internet
    whois
    DNS
    IP Blocks
    Source Code
    Social Networks
    web srv content
    OS detecting
    Job Sites - if they are looking for a Linux expert, they likely have 
Linux on their server.

The places to start are normally:

    The Internet
    Social Media
    whois
    DNS

DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
